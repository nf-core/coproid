abstract = {Shotgun metagenomics applied to archaeological feces (paleofeces) can bring new insights into the composition and functions of human and animal gut microbiota from the past. However, paleofeces often undergo physical distortions in archaeological sediments, making their source species difficult to identify on the basis of fecal morphology or microscopic features alone. Here we present a reproducible and scalable pipeline using both host and microbial DNA to infer the host source of fecal material. We apply this pipeline to newly sequenced archaeological specimens and show that we are able to distinguish morphologically similar human and canine paleofeces, as well as non-fecal sediments, from a range of archaeological contexts.},

abstract = {Genomic‐level analyses of DNA from non‐invasive sources would facilitate powerful conservation and evolutionary studies in natural populations of endangered and otherwise elusive species. However, the typical low quantity and poor quality of DNA that is extracted from non‐invasive samples have generally precluded such work. Here we apply a modified DNA capture protocol that, when used in combination with massively‐parallel sequencing technology, facilitates efficient and highly‐accurate resequencing of megabases of specified nuclear genomic regions from fecal DNA samples. We validated our approach by comparing genetic variants identified from corresponding fecal and blood DNA samples of six western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) across more than 1.5 megabases of chromosome 21, chromosome X, and the complete mitochondrial genome. Our results suggest that it is now feasible to conduct genomic studies in natural populations for which constraints on invasive sampling have otherwise long been a barrier. The data we collected also provided an opportunity to examine western chimpanzee genetic diversity at unprecedented scale. Despite high mitochondrial genome diversity (π = 0.585%), western chimpanzees have a low ratio (0.42) of X chromosomal (π = 0.034%) to autosomal (chromosome 21 π = 0.081%) sequence diversity, a pattern that may reflect an unusual demographic history of this subspecies.},

To make best use of these threads, genomics software must contend with new and subtle computer architecture issues. We discuss some of these and propose methods for improving thread scaling in tools that analyze each read independently, such as read aligners.We implement these methods in new versions of Bowtie, Bowtie 2 and HISAT. We greatly improve thread scaling in many scenarios, including on the recent Intel Xeon Phi architecture. We also highlight how bottlenecks are exacerbated by variable-record-length file formats like FASTQ and suggest changes that enable superior scaling.Experiments for this study: https://github.com/BenLangmead/bowtie-scaling.http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net.http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2.http://www.ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisatSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Motivation Quality control and preprocessing of FASTQ files are essential to providing clean data for downstream analysis. Traditionally, a different tool is used for each operation, such as quality control, adapter trimming and quality filtering. These tools are often insufficiently fast as most are developed using high-level programming languages (e.g. Python and Java) and provide limited multi-threading support. Reading and loading data multiple times also renders preprocessing slow and I/O inefficient. Results We developed fastp as an ultra-fast FASTQ preprocessor with useful quality control and data-filtering features. It can perform quality control, adapter trimming, quality filtering, per-read quality pruning and many other operations with a single scan of the FASTQ data. This tool is developed in C++ and has multi-threading support. Based on our evaluation, fastp is 2-5 times faster than other FASTQ preprocessing tools such as Trimmomatic or Cutadapt despite performing far more operations than similar tools.

Our protocol describes the execution of the Kraken programs, via a sequence of easy-to-use scripts, in two scenarios: (1) quantification of the species in a given metagenomics sample; and (2) detection of a pathogenic agent from a clinical sample taken from a human patient. The protocol, which is executed within 1–2 h, is targeted to biologists and clinicians working in microbiome or metagenomics analysis who are familiar with the Unix command-line environment.},

            Motivation: Fast and accurate quality control is essential for studies involving next-generation sequencing data. Whilst numerous tools exist to quantify {QC} metrics, there is no common approach to flexibly integrate these across tools and large sample sets. Assessing analysis results across an entire project can be time consuming and error prone; batch effects and outlier samples can easily be missed in the early stages of analysis.
            Results: We present {MultiQC}, a tool to create a single report visualising output from multiple tools across many samples, enabling global trends and biases to be quickly identified. {MultiQC} can plot data from many common bioinformatics tools and is built to allow easy extension and customization.
